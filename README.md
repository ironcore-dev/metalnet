Metalnet is a stack of kubernetes controller applications to fulfill the requirements on creating functional virtual network elements, by interacting with our other software components such as [metalbond](https://github.com/ironcore-dev/metalbond) and [dp-service](https://github.com/ironcore-dev/dpservice). It manages the lifecycles of virtual network related kubernetes objects, to ensure successful communication for virtual machines.
